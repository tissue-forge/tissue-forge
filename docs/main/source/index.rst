Tissue Forge Documentation
***************************

Tissue Forge is an interactive, particle-based physics, chemistry and biology
modeling and simulation environment. Tissue Forge provides the ability to create,
simulate and explore models, simulations and virtual experiments of soft condensed
matter physics at multiple scales using a simple, intuitive interface. Tissue Forge
is designed with an emphasis on problems in complex subcellular, cellular and tissue
biophysics. Tissue Forge enables interactive work with simulations on heterogeneous
computing architectures, where models and simulations can be built and interacted
with in real-time during execution of a simulation, and computations can be selectively
offloaded onto available GPUs on-the-fly.

Tissue Forge is a native compiled C++ shared library that's designed to be used for model
and simulation specification in compiled C++ code. Tissue Forge includes extensive C, C++ and
Python APIs and additional support for interactive model and simulation specification in
an IPython console and a Jupyter Notebook. Tissue Forge currently supports installations on
64-bit Windows, Linux and MacOS systems.

.. note::

   Tissue Forge supports modeling and simulation in multiple programming languages.
   While many variables, classes and methods are named and behave the same across
   all supported languages, inevitably there are some differences.
   Most examples in this documentation demonstrate usage in Python, and specific
   cases where Tissue Forge behaves differently in a particular language are explicitly
   addressed. In general, assume that a documented example or code snippet in one
   language is the same in another unless stated otherwise. For specific details
   about Tissue Forge in a particular language, refer to
   :ref:`Tissue Forge API Reference <api_reference>`.

**Funding**

Tissue Forge is funded with generous support by NIBIB U24 EB028887.
