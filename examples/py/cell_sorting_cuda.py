"""
Derived from cell_sorting.py, demonstrating runtime-control of GPU acceleration with CUDA.

A callback is implemented such that every time the key "S" is pressed on the keyboard,
Tissue Forge will test and report CPU vs. GPU performance.

Note that this demo will not run for Tissue Forge installations that do not have GPU support enabled.
